File_Parse
==========

C++ Polymorphic classes used for parsing files. Just a centralized repo for keeping track of development on code used in several projects.

To use, just create an object of type TTxt_File, & pass the file location & string to the constructor.
Calling save file with the autodestruct parameter == true saves the file, then calls the destructor of that object.
